# Expressions and scenarios – MÄÄK mascot

Visual behavior guide for illustration and export. These define animation rhythm and body language, not just poses.

## Expression set (core)

| Expression | Use for | Visual |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Calm / Idle** | Home, chat list, pauses | Soft breathing belly, slow blink, tiny smile, grounded posture |
| **Encouraging** | First message, profile completion, onboarding | Gentle nod, offering something small (light, leaf, lantern – not a big heart) |
| **Thinking (AI)** | AI mode | Reading, puzzle pieces, floating symbols, soft glow |
| **Waiting** | Loading states | Sitting, making tea, knitting, watering plant, looking at phone calmly. Time is safe here. |
| **Social** | Connection | Two mascots sitting together, holding chat bubble, small wave |
| **Sleeping / Offline** | Offline | Sleeping, blanket, stars, lantern nearby |

## Scenario set (product feature)

The mascot is doing something meaningful, not just posing. Each scenario maps to an app moment.

| Scenario | Token | App moment |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| Planting a seed | mascot_planting_seed | Empty matches – metaphor for time and growth |
| Making tea | mascot_waiting_tea | Loading – time is safe here |
| Practicing "hej" in mirror | mascot_practicing_mirror | No chats – vulnerable, human, warm |
| Lighting a lantern | mascot_lighting_lantern | First match – meaningful connection (no confetti) |
| Calm idle | mascot_calm_idle | Hero intro, onboarding, empty states, success corner |
| AI: listening / thinking / answering / celebrating | mascot_ai_* | Landing hero, problem, AI assistant |

## AI assistant personality

"En lugn vän som hjälper, inte en robot."

| Mode | Pose language |
