## Learnings
- `types_new.ts` was an artifact from failed `supabase gen types` - deleted
- Migrations follow idempotent pattern with `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS`
- User references use `auth.users(id)` not a profiles table FK

## Iteration 3 - US-003: Update generate-icebreakers for profile context
- What was implemented: Verified that US-003 was already fully implemented in previous work
- Files changed: PRD.md (marked complete), progress.txt (updated)
- Implementation details found in `supabase/functions/generate-icebreakers/index.ts`:
  - Lines 99-133: Fetches both users' profiles with bio, looking_for, work, education, hometown
  - Lines 147-149: Finds common interests between users
  - Lines 152-181: `buildProfileContext()` builds rich context including interests, bio, etc.
  - Lines 187-212: Enhanced AI prompt includes all profile context and shared interests
  - Lines 303-340: `getFallbackIcebreakers()` provides personality-based fallback
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Check existing code thoroughly before implementing - features may already exist
  - The edge function uses LOVABLE_API_KEY for AI calls via `ai.gateway.lovable.dev`
  - Profile data comes from `profiles` table, personality from `personality_results` table
