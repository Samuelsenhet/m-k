# Ralph task – one iteration without Claude CLI

When the user says **"run Ralph"**, **"next Ralph task"**, **"do one Ralph iteration"**, or similar:

1. **Read** `docs/setup/NÄSTA STEG – FULL ROADMAP (TASK FÖR TASK)` and `progress.txt` (section "## Completed tasks").
2. **Pick** the next single task from the current STEG (0–7) that is not yet in Completed tasks.
3. **Do it:**
   - If it’s a doc task (e.g. STEG 0, 1.1, 1.2): create or update the required file (e.g. `docs/PRODUCT_PHILOSOPHY.md`, `docs/UIX_AUDIT.md`, `docs/DESIGN_DEBT.md`).
   - If it’s implementation: follow the philosophy in `docs/PRODUCT_PHILOSOPHY.md` and the agent prompts in `.cursor/`; implement one task only.
4. **Verify:** Run `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` (or build if relevant). Fix any errors.
5. **Update** `progress.txt`: append the completed task under "## Completed tasks", and any notes under "## Learnings".
6. **Suggest** a commit message, e.g. `feat: [short task description]`.

Philosophy (from PRODUCT_PHILOSOPHY.md): Passa → Chatta → Se profil; no swipe/likes/ranking; profile secondary, chat primary. If a change breaks this, treat it as a bug and propose a compliant alternative.

If all STEG 0–7 are complete, say so and output that the roadmap is complete.
